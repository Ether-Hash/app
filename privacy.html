  <p id="pt0">After withdrawal previouse password was removed and cannot be used anymore <br>because algorithm use
    hash of password as a proof.After withdrawal you share hash <br> of password and this is not secure anymore.

  <p id="pt1">Make shure you use different IP addresses for deposits and withdrawal. <br> We recommend using a TOR browser or VPN service.</p>
  <div class="dot" id="dot2"></div>
  <p id="pt2">Make sure you clear cookies for dApps before using your new address, because if a dApp <br> sees both old and new addresses with the same cookies it will know that addresses are from the same owner. <br> A good way to do this is by using a new identity (browser, wallet, IP) for the funds of your new address.</p>


  <div class="dot" id="dot3"></div>
  <p id="pt3">If a deposit and a withdrawal are right next to each other, it is very likely that they belong to the same person. <br> We recommend waiting until at least a few deposits are made after yours before withdrawing</p>
